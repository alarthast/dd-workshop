# Welcome to the workshop

Go to <https://opensafely.github.io/dummy-data-workshop> to follow along.

## Prerequisites

The ehrQL code that we'll look at in this workshop is not very complicated,
however, it is assumed that you are not *completely* new to ehrQL. If you
need a reminder, please see the [ehrQL checklist] TODO: add url.

Some previous experience writing code in R is recommended.

## Setup your codespace

Please go to <https://github.com/opensafely/dummy-data-workshop>

Click on the "Use this template" button, and select "Open in a workspace"

![Open codespace button](images/codespace_btn.png)

The codespace will take several minutes to launch. Please wait!

!!! Warning

  The codespace will launch with the updated version of ehrQL and R that you need
  for this workshop. You should ignore any terminal reminders to run `opensafely pull`,
  as this will replace the custom R images that we are using. If you need to, you can
  update the R images again by running `update_r` in your codespace terminal.
